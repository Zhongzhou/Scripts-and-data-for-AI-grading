For this problem I used this equation: 0.5k(l-l0)^2 = 0.5mv^2 + mglsin(theta). However, because this isn't at a specific angle, I decided to modify it and replace theta with height so that the equation now looks like this. 0.5k(l-l0)^2 = 0.5mv^2 + mglsin(h). I know that this was probably the wrong thing to do, but I got stuck, and omitting height/sin(theta) entirely gives you a negative answer before you can even square root it, which is a syntax error.

  - The student does not explicitly write down a conservation of mechanical energy equation or mention energy or mechanical energy directly.

- **Explanation Analysis**: The student's equation \( 0.5k(l-l_0)^2 = 0.5mv^2 + mgl \sin(\theta) \) initially contains an elastic potential energy term ( \( 0.5k(l-l_0)^2 \) ).
  - They incorrectly modify the equation to \( 0.5k(l-l_0)^2 = 0.5mv^2 + mgl \sin(h) \) which incorrectly implies gravitational potential energy.
- **Evaluation**:
  - The student does not mention gravitational potential energy in the correct form.
  - Elastic potential energy is implied correctly.
  - However, since both potential energy terms need to be correctly stated or implied, and the gravitational potential energy term is not correctly formulated, it fails this rubric item.
- **Grading**: The student's explanation only partially meets the requirement and doesn't fully satisfy the item. **0**

### Item 3: Gravitational Potential Energy Term
- **Explanation Analysis**: The gravitational potential energy term \( mgl \sin(\theta) \) and its modified form \( mgl \sin(h) \) are incorrect.
  - The term should correctly account for the initial height \( h \) and the changes in height due to compression.
- **Evaluation**:
  - The student does not use any correct form of gravitational potential energy such as \( mg(h + L - L_0) \).

2. My solution had four phases. I began by both setting up a diagram of the spring and setting up the conservation of energy equation for the problem (in this case being EPE+KE=GPE) as well as setting the 0 point for my GPE. Then I calculated the objects final GPE using the equation mhg where h was the final height above the spring as well as the compressed length of the spring. When I had that number i then calculated the EPE of the spring by using 1/2k|si-sf|^2, after subtracting that number from the GPE we then get the initial KE for the ball. Using the KE equation we can solve for the objects initial velocity using 1/2mv^2 setting it equal to the GPE-EPE, giving us our final velocity.","Let's evaluate the student's explanation against each rubric item:

### Item 1: The student wrote down conservation of mechanical energy equation or indicated that mechanical energy can be used to solve the problem

**Reasoning:**
The student clearly states ""I used conservation of Mechanical energy = MEf-MEi=0 because sum of nonconservative work is 0."" This indicates that the student is applying the principle of conservation of mechanical energy to solve the problem.

**Grade:**
1

### Item 2: The potential energy term of the conservation of mechanical energy formula contains both a gravitational potential energy term and an elastic potential energy term.

**Reasoning:**
The student's equation ""mg deltah = .5 mv^2 + .5 k (L-Lo)^2"" includes a gravitational potential energy term (mg deltah) and an elastic potential energy term (.5 k (L-Lo)^2). Thus, the explanation contains both required potential energy terms.

**Grade:**
1

### Item 3: The gravitational potential energy term contains an expression similar to mg(h + L - L_0), and shouldn't be just mgh or mgL

**Reasoning:**
The student's gravitational potential energy term is written as ""mg ( (Lo-L0 +h)"" which appears to be a typo. The correct expression should be ""mg (h + (L0 - L))"" or similar, combining the initial height, h, and the displacement caused by the spring compression. The expression is not fully clear and seems incorrect.
