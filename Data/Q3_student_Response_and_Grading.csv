Since the masses are stuck together, the final momentum is the sum of the two masses times the final velocity

471221,"I am solving for the magnitude of the velocity after the two objects collide given two masses (m1 and m2), two velocities (v1 and v2), and an angle (theta). This problem was around 3 steps, finding starter equations, rewriting them to appeal to the situation, and then isolating/plugging in variables.
For this problem, I used px = m1v1 + theta = (m1+m2)vfx and py= m2v2 + theta = (m1+m2)vfy. These are setting up the x and y velocities. Rewriting these equations you'd get (m1v1 + theta)/(m1+m2) = vfx and (m2v2 + theta)/(m1+m2) = vfy. As there was no theta for the x-axis, you wouldn't add anything to this equation. Adding up the two equations (because of Newton's Law) and doing the distance formula gets you the combined final velocity of both axes and the magnitude of the velocity after the collision. This would be: sqrt( ((m1v1)^2 + (m2v2+theta)^2)/m1 + m2). I substituted the numbers I needed into this equation to get my combined final velocity.","Let's go through the student's explanation step by step and evaluate it according to the grading rubric:

### Item 1: Decomposition of initial linear momentum of boulder 2 into its x and y components
- **Evaluation:** The student states, ""For this problem, I used px = m1v1 + theta = (m1+m2)vfx and py= m2v2 + theta = (m1+m2)vfy."" However, the student fails to explicitly mention decomposing the velocity of the second boulder (v2) into its x and y components. Instead, the term ""theta"" is incorrectly used in the momentum equations. The proper step should involve breaking down v2 into \(v2_x = v2 \cos(\theta)\) and \(v2_y = v2 \sin(\theta)\). Hence, the student did not perform this decomposition correctly.
- **Grade:** 0

### Item 2: Conservation of linear momentum equation for both x and y directions
- **Evaluation:** The student wrote down momentum equations as ""px = m1v1 + theta = (m1+m2)vfx"" and ""py= m2v2 + theta = (m1+m2)vfy."" While the student attempted to write down momentum equations for both directions, these equations are incorrect. The correct conservation equations should be:
  \[
  m1 \cdot v1 + m2 \cdot v2 \cos(\theta) = (m1 + m2) \cdot vfx
  \]
  \[
  m2 \cdot v2 \sin(\theta) = (m1 + m2) \cdot vfy
  \]
  The inclusion of ""theta"" directly as a term in the equations is incorrect.
- **Grade:** 0

### Item 3: Use of Pythagorean theorem to find the magnitude of the final velocity
- **Evaluation:** The student states, ""Adding up the two equations (because of Newton's Law) and doing the distance formula gets you the combined final velocity of both axes and the magnitude of the velocity after the collision."" The student also writes, ""sqrt(((m1v1)^2 + (m2v2+theta)^2)/m1 + m2)."" While the student attempts to use a form of the Pythagorean theorem, the expression provided is incorrect and poorly formulated. It should be:
  \[
  v_f = \sqrt{v_{fx}^2 + v_{fy}^2}
  \]
  The student's expression does not correctly apply this theorem.
- **Grade:** 0

The student’s explanation did not satisfy any of the rubric items satisfactorily.

**Item 1: The student considered the x and y components of the linear momentum of the second boulder separately.**

- The student mentioned px and py and recognized the need for x and y components.
- However, the student did not decompose m2v2 into its x and y components using trigonometric functions (m2v2cos(theta) and m2v2sin(theta)).
- Instead, the student incorrectly added theta directly to the equations as if it were a term of linear momentum, which it is not.

Thus, the student did not correctly consider the x and y components of the linear momentum of the second boulder separately.

**Grade: 0**

**Item 2: The student wrote down conservation of linear momentum equations for both the x and y directions independently.**

- The student attempted to write conservation of momentum equations for both the x and y directions.
- However, the equations provided are incorrect. For example, px = m1v1 + theta is incorrect because theta is not a term of momentum. Similarly, py= m2v2 + theta is incorrect.
- The student did not correctly apply the conservation of momentum in the x and y directions separately.

Thus, the student's explanation does not satisfy this rubric item.

**Grade: 0**

**Item 3: The student used Pythagorean theorem to find the magnitude of the final velocity.**

- The student mentioned using the ""distance formula"" (referring to the Pythagorean theorem).

2. I used two steps for this problem

3. Step 1: Use the equation P = mv and the fact that this is an elastic collision, therefore momentum is conserved. using both of these facts I set up the equation m1v1 + m2v2 = mfvf where v2 is being multiplied by the sine of the angle of collision and mf is equal to both of the masses added together.Â 

Step 2: plug values into the equation and solve","**Item 1: The student solution decomposed the initial linear momentum of boulder 2 into its x and y components.**

Reasoning: The student states that they use the equation m1v1 + m2v2 = mfvf where v2 is being multiplied by the sine of the angle of collision. However, this is not a complete decomposition into x and y components since it only mentions the sine component (presumably for y) and neglects the cosine component (presumably for x). Therefore, the student's explanation does not fully satisfy the requirement of decomposing the initial momentum into both x and y components.
